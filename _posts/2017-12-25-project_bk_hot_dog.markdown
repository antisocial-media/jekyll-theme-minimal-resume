This is a game I developed at Gamewheel for Burger King Germany, when they decided to promote the addtion of hot dogs to their menu. The game concept builds on top of the catcher game, where you have to collect certain objects and avoid obstacles. You are playing a hot dog saussage and have to collect Burger King coins and avoid various obstacles.

If you play the game on desktop you can control the player with the arrow keys on the keyboard or alternatively with the mouse. On mobile phones the player is controlled with the gyroscope by tilting your phone in the desired direction.
